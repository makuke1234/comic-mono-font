# Comic Mono
A legible monospace font... Now with more glyphs and Python3 support!
This font is a fork of [dtinth](https://github.com/dtinth)â€™s [Comic Mono Font](https://github.com/dtinth/comic-mono-font) (version 0.1.1).

To build it yourself you'll have to install [FontForge]() and also download [Comic Shanns v2](https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns)
&amp; [Cousine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cousine)
